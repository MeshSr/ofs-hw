/*!
	\brief The nbPacketEngine class provides a rich set of methods and properties to initialize 
	and use the netil compiler and the NetVM engine. 
	The nbPacketEngine class allows to perform processing of the packet and to get information about extracted field, 
	using the nbExtractedFieldsReader class and some other structures such as _nbFieldDescriptor. 
	
	To initialize the compiler and the NetVM engine use the following methods:
	- If the compiler is called for the first time in the program, use the Compile() method that allows to set the filter. 
		If a previous compiler object is allocated and a filter is already set, use the CompileEx() method to add other rules to the compiler (not implemented).
	- If the compiler is initialized use the InitNVM method that allows to initialize the environment and the socket variables.
	- If a compiled filter is available use the Initialize method to set 'extractfields' structures.
	- To set a COMPILE_ONLY mode for the NetVM engine use GenerateBackendCode method.
	
	To process a packet with the compiler and the netVM:
	- Call the ProcessPacket method that returns nbSUCCESS if the filter is successful and no error occurred, nbFAILURE otherwise. 
		The return code strictly depends on the result of the packet filter, even if the processing program involves also the 'extractfields' capability of this engine.
	
	To get the structures containing the field extraction information:
	- Call the GetExtractedFieldsReader method that returns a nbExtractedFieldsReader object 
	that will be used to parse the extracted fields in order to print their values and such. 
		This method must be used when the nbPacketEngine class is configured to extract fields from the packet. 
		If in the filter there isn't the ExtractFields action this method returns a nbExtractedFieldsReader object with a DescriptorVector object empty.
	
	The nbPacketEngine class allows you to configure the debug compiler options using the SetXXX methods. 
	
	To get compiling information and structures:
	- The messages created by the compilation are available with the GetCompMessageList  that returns a pointer to a CompilerMessage structures. 
	- To get the last error message call the GetLastError method.
	- The NETIL compiled code  is available with the GetCompiledCode method.
	- The _nvmRuntimeEnvironment is available with the GetNetVMRuntimeEnvironment method.
	
	The nbPacketEngine class must be allocated using the nbAllocatePacketEngine function because it’s an abstract class. The de-allocation is done nbDeallocatePacketEngine function.
